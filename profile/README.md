# Overview

Welcome to the home for the Data Sciences Institute's (DSI) Certificates at the University of Toronto. The Data Science and Machine Learning Software Foundations Certificates are offered with the financial support of Upskill Canada, powered by Palette Skills and the Government of Canada. The Certificates are designed for mid-career professionals looking to make a career transition into roles where they can apply data science and machine learning skills. Profesisonals with a university or college degree or diploma, and who have three years or more of work experience are eligible to [apply](https://certificates.datasciences.utoronto.ca/)

Participants who successfully complete the certificate will be able to:  
- Demonstrate a solid understanding of data science principles
- Effectively use command line interfaces and version control software. 
- Apply practical programming language skills in Python.
- Effectively interact with relational databases through queries and data manipulation using SQL commands. 
- Design, implement, test and validate various supervised learning models.
- Apply structured approaches to build, maintain, and improve robust software. 

Participants who complete the Data Science Certificate will be equipped with the skills to explore data sampling methods for reliable analysis and to master visualization techniques, which facilitates easier interpretation and decision-making with complex data sets. Those who complete the Machine Learning Software Foundations Certificate will gain proficiency in advanced predictive analysis techniques, understand comprehensive model evaluation strategies for reliable predictions, and acquire foundational knowledge in deep learning, including neural network applications.
