# Overview

This houses the curriculum for a professional program of introduction to data science and machine learning. It is composed of a variety of courses, each of around 20-30 hours contact time (with additional work expected outside classes). While the courses are modular, the foundational skills are drawn on in the others. 

The typical student is someone new to data science and machine learning, who is interested in developing skills that they can apply in a professional setting.
